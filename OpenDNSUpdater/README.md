# OpenDNS updater

Since the one on OpenDNS wiki page recommends downloading to file, which will ruin the onboard flash if ran often enough, I've decided to write and publish this one, we use amazons checkip service, because then we don't get api throttled by OpenDNS webservice and don't have to add ugly delays in the script.
