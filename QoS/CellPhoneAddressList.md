# CellPhoneAddressList

## Function
The function of this script is to create an address list with local IP addresses of "all"(most) mobile devices, so they can be queued separately from regular devices. Which can be good to prevent smartphone users from unintentionally killing the network by syncing data with iCloud/Google Photos etc...


## Notes
This script should be run once every second for best effect. (Once every few seconds is ok too).

This script is not meant to prevent malicious users from overloading the network, but rather prevent unintentional DoS from employees who connect their phones to WiFi.
